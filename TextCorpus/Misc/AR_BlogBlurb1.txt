I’ve been sleeping a lot lately. I think its due to stress. I went from being crippled by depression, where my days were filled with mindless wanderings on the internet, to trying to start my own business. The change of pace is stressful, but of course, necessary.

10:18 AM: I arrived at the hackerspace about 15 minutes ago. I set an agenda for myself. I slept the day away yesterday. I need to figure out why I’m tired all the time. Yes, stress can be one culprit. The weather is probably another factor.

Computational seeds blossoming.

Theory of forms due

Drop seeds all over image have it blossom. Objects recognized by common seed bloom behavior. Bloom on laxer definitions of sameness. Start with binary.
